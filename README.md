# ShoppingCart

This applicataion is to use a restocking function to restock products. User will select the green product add button to add an item to the cart. The reduction of stock will be refactored at a later date. The item will appear in the cart. The item will also appear in checkout. To restock the products press the restock button. The onclick will fetch data created in a back end. I used Postman and strapi.
